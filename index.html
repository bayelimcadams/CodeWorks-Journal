  <h1 style="padding-left:20px;">March 9th - Day 1</h1>

  <p style="padding-left:10px;">Day 1 is rules, regs, and environment setup day. Today I am relatively solid on html and css from previous experience in web design. I'm still iffy on javascript, it's not yet comfortable or easy but I am slowly developing an understanding.</p>

  <h1 style="padding-left:20px;">March 20th - End of week 2</h1>

  <p style="padding-left:10px;">Today we are starting checkpoint two, it is a game involving bootstrap, javascript, points, incriments, automatic/manual upgrades, etc. At this point I am understanding and implimenting bootstrap and the bootstrap grid system well into my projects, however as we get deeper into javascript I feel kind of lost while slowly improving and advancing my knowledge every day. This course continues to get tougher every day, but I am so excited to push through and learn more and more through every challenge and question.</p>
